/**
 * Redux Store Configuration
 *
 * This file sets up the central Redux store for the application.
 *
 * Key aspects:
 * - Uses configureStore from @reduxjs/toolkit to create the store.
 * - Combines reducers for messages and contacts.
 * - Exports the configured store and AppDispatch type.
 *
 * Store structure:
 * - messageState: Managed by messageReducer
 * - contactState: Managed by contactReducer
 * - incidentState: Managed by incidentReducer
 * - profileState: Managed by profileReducer
 * - patientState: Managed by patientReducer
 * - snackbarState: Managed by snackbarReducer
 * - storage: Managed by storageReducer
 * - hospital: Managed by hospitalReducer
 * - notifyState: Managed by notifyReducer
 * - alertQueue: Managed by alertQueueReducer
 *
 * Types:
 * - AppDispatch: Exported for use in typed dispatch calls.
 * - RootState: Commented out, but can be used for accessing full state type.
 *
 * Usage:
 * Import this store in the main app file to provide Redux state management
 * to the entire application.
